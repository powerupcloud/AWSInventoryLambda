# AWSInventoryLambda

## What?

A simple python script to save your AWS inventory details to a CSV file, store it on S3 and trigger an email.

## How to use? 

Just use the script.py as Lambda function code and schedule a job. You may also schedule it as a standalone job without using lambda. For more details about how to schedule this as a job using lambda, read this [step by step guide](http://blog.powerupcloud.com/2016/02/07/aws-inventory-details-in-csv-using-lambda/)
